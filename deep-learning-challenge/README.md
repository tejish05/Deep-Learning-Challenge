# Credit Risk Analysis Report

Overview
In this project, i used a special tool called a neural network to help a nonprofit organization called Alphabet Soup. This organization wants to choose the best applicants to fund their ventures. To make this decision, I  analyzed a large dataset containing information about more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup in the past. I used machine learning techniques to build a computer program that can predict if an applicant will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Results:

Data Preprocessing:
I have identified the main piece of information we want to predict, which is whether an applicant will be successful or not (a binary outcome).
I have also selected several other pieces of information about the applicants that we think might be important for making predictions, such as the type of application they submitted, their affiliation, the classification of their organization, and more.
I removed some identification columns that don't help us make predictions, such as the applicant's ID number and name.

Building and Evaluating the Model:
I used a special type of computer program called a neural network, which is inspired by the human brain, to help us make predictions.
This neural network has several layers of interconnected nodes that can learn patterns from the data.
I tried different combinations of the number of nodes and the mathematical functions that the nodes use to make predictions.
I  trained the neural network using the dataset, trying to find the best settings for the nodes and functions to make accurate predictions.


Summary:
In this project, I used a computer program called a neural network to predict the success of funding applicants for Alphabet Soup. I analyzed a dataset containing information about past applicants to find patterns and make predictions. Despite trying different techniques, I couldn't achieve the desired level of accuracy in our predictions.
